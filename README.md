# SignMeApp

Android app project attemtpting to create a unique functionality. An app that notifies fellow students, who also have the app installed, to sign for your presence at a lecture. This way you can be absent from most lectures and the app will try its best to notify others of your absence. Beer is used as a currency, so as when someone signs for you, you owe them a beer and vice-versa.

This is a cool concept but unfortunately never gained much light.

It was developed by me and few of my colleagues as a part of the University Curriculum.
